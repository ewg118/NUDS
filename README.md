NUDS
====

The Numismatic Description Schema is a codified XML schema based on numismatic database fields proposed by Sebastian Heath and Andrew Meadows. These fields, called the Numismatic Description Standard, are detailed at [http://www.greekcoinage.org/nuds.html](http://www.greekcoinage.org/nuds.html), and were originally published on [Nomisma.org](http://nomisma.org/). The NUDS XML schema is based on this field list and Ethan Gruber's preliminary work mapping coins to Encoded Archival Description, which was detailed in a 2009 Computer Applications in Archaeology paper, ["Encoded Archival Description for Numismatic Collections"](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.258051). It is also influenced by the structure of TEI and EAC-CPF, common standards in the Digital Humanities, library and archival domains. Ideally, a NUDS record should implement XLink attributes to integrate URIs to external controlled Linked Open Data controlled vocabulary systems, such as concepts defined on Nomisma.org itself.
